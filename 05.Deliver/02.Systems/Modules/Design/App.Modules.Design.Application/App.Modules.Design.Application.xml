            Discoverable (by Reflection) Module specific configuration
            of the DependencyLocator.
            <para>
            Note that it is important that these common classes
            are just called 'Module'Something and not 'ModuleXXX'Something,
            (and just use the Namespace to distinguish between Modules)
            so that it is easier to start new development just using Search/Replace
            within namespaces (it's easier to find `Module1` within `.Module1`
            than find the same thing within `Module1Something`.
