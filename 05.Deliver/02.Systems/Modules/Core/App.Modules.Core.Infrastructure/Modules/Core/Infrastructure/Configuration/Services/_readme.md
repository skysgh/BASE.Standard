Configuration Objects are not going to ever be swapped out...so we can safely dispense with
having to make a Contract for them before making an implementation.

But keeping the same Contract/nested Implementation folder structure convention going everywhere
decreases confusion, ensuring everyone on a team knows where to create new Implementations, 
and where others should look for them.
